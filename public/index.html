      <h2>About Us</h2>

        We are KodeVana, a freelancing agency located in BTR Assam, India. Our
        team is dedicated to providing high-quality digital solutions. We have
        developed the BFP app (Bodoland Peoples' Front) for the political party

      <h2>Data Collection</h2>
      <p>
        The BFP app allows users to consume content such as daily posts, party
        events, and achievements without logging in. However, certain features
        such as donate and join the party require users to log in and provide
        user details. The collected data are only used for user verification
        purposes, distinguishing between party members and general users who log
        in to the app. We ensure that the data collection process is transparent
        and users are informed about the types of data being collected and the
        purposes for which it will be used.

      <h2>Data Usage</h2>
      <p>
        All user data collected by the BFP app are strictly used within the app
        for user verification purposes. This includes determining whether a user
        is a party member or a general user. We do not share any user data with
        third parties. Additionally, we take appropriate measures to ensure the
        security and confidentiality of user data. Our team regularly reviews
        and updates our security practices to protect against unauthorized
        access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of user information.
